Concisely display monthly archives by year with links to each month.

== Description ==

Display monthly archives by year with links to each month in the following compact format:

    2012
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    2011
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
    
    2010
    6 7 8 9 10 11 12

Serves as a drop in replacement for `wp_get_archives( array( 'type' => 'monthly' )`.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file, drop the contents in your wp-content/plugins/ directory, and then activate from the Plugins page.
1. Edit your theme file (e.g. sidebar.php) and replace the WordPress template tag `wp_get_archives();` with `monthchunks();`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I make the years display in ascending order (2010, 2011, 2012...) instead of descending (the default)? =

The monthchunks function takes two optional parameters and the first is `year_order`, which accepts two string values: `"descending"` or `"ascending"`.

= How do I make the months display using the first letters of the month's name (J, F, M...) instead of numbers (the default)? =

The monthchunks function takes two optional parameters and the second is `month_format`, which accepts two string values: `"numeric"` or `"alpha"`.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is how Monthchunks looks on the Twenty Eleven theme. Four years of archives (up to 48 links) take up only 200 vertical pixels of precious sidebar real estate. If you're on a monthly archive page, that month's number is bold, but not a link. If you hover over any month, you'll see the full localized month name and year as a *tooltip*.

== Changelog ==
= 2.3 =
* Use WordPress' Date and Time Locale object to localize month names in tooltip
* Change default year_order sort to descending (more closely matches wp_get_archives)
* Appropriately escape html output (though largely unnecessary)

= 2.2 =
* Generate output with a single SQL query, instead of N+1, where N was the number of years of post archives

= 2.1 =
* Add year_order and month_format options
* Add `title="month_name year"` attribute (aka tooltips) to the month links 
* Lmited visible archives to posts with post_status = 'publish'
* Revise pretty html output slightly
* Add semifix for year = "0000" bug

= 2.0 =
* Remove `<ul></ul>` output to make monthchunks more of a drop-in replacement for `wp_get_archives()`
* Add logic to de-link from current month
* Sort years in chronlogical order
* Don't print separator space after last month of year

= 1.2 =
* Use `$wpdb->posts` instead of `wp_posts` as table name
